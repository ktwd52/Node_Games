The program should take an English phrase as an input from process.argv.
Convert each word to Pig Latin:
If a word starts with a consonant (msh) and a vowel (mgh), put the first letter of the word at the end of the word and add “ay.”
Example: Happy = appyh + ay = appyhay
If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add “ay.”
Example: Child = Ildch + ay = Ildchay
If a word starts with a vowel add the word “way” at the end of the word.
Example: Awesome = Awesome +way = Awesomeway
Output the translated phrase to the console.
